    " - **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from Unity Catalog volume (Streaming Tables)\n",
    " - **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and enriched data with business logic (Materialized Views)\n",
    " - **Gold Layer**: Aggregated and analytical tables for reporting (Materialized Views)\n",
    " \n",
    " ## Core Datasets:\n",
    " 1. **Truck Productivity Events**: Operational events with delays and breakdowns (80% productive)\n",
    " 2. **Truck Cycles**: Loading and dumping transactions with source/destination and timing\n",
    " 3. **Time Usage Model**: Event categorization for operational efficiency analysis\n",
    " \n",
    " ## Data Flow:\n",
    " 1. **Bronze Tables**: Load raw parquet files from `/Volumes/mining_operations/production/raw_data/` as streaming tables\n",
    " 2. **Silver Views**: Apply data quality checks, transformations, and business rules as materialized views\n",
    " 3. **Gold Views**: Create analytical views and aggregations for operational efficiency insights as materialized views"
